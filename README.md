# Vigilante_Driver_Safety_Monitoring_System

The Vigilante Driver Safety Monitoring System is a real-time, AI-powered computer vision solution designed to enhance road safety by monitoring driver alertness. It detects two key indicators of driver drowsiness:

1. Eye Drowsiness: Identified by analyzing the degree of eye-opening and signs of closure.
2. Yawning Action: Monitored through the jaw's width to determine signs of fatigue-related yawning.
If either or both indicators are detected on the driverâ€™s face, the system triggers an audible warning alert with a beep sound. This immediate response helps awaken the driver and prompts them to refocus on driving, reducing the risk of accidents caused by fatigue.
